# Booking Technical Test Submission Ioana Ionita
## Setup
```
For Part 1, the code was written as a console application (using as IDE Visual Studio 2017).

```

## Part 1
```
After opening "BookingTest.sln" and running "Program.cs", in /BookingTest/bin/Debug, 
the executable "BookingTest.exe" is created.
Once the executable is run, it will ask for pickup and dropoff coordinates.

```
### To print the search results for Dave's Taxis:
```
Write "dave" in the console (similarly, writing "jeff" or "eric" will return the search 
results for Jeff's Taxis, or, respectively, Eric's Taxis).
```

### To filter by number of passengers:
```
Introduce the number of passengers and then the filter will be applied to the search results obtained before.
```

## Part 2
```
The Searches.html file provides the opportunity to enter the pickup and dropoff locations 
and choosing the supplier wanted. Using an ajax call, the methods written before 
were meant to be called, however the methods were not properly called. 
The behaviour expected is illustrated by creating an identical ajax call directly to the api. 
By clicking the "Search for option" button the results are returned in the json format. 
```
