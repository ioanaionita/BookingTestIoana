# Booking Technical Test Submission Ioana Ionita
## Setup
```
For Part 1, the code was written as a console application (using as IDE Visual Studio 2017).

```

## Part 1
```
After opening "BookingTest.sln" and running "Program.cs", in /BookingTest/bin/Debug, 
the executable "BookingTest.exe" is created.
Once the executable is run, it will ask for pickup and dropoff coordinates.

```
### To print the search results for Dave's Taxis:
```
Write "dave" in the console (similarly, writing "jeff" or "eric" will return the search 
results for Jeff's Taxis, or, respectively, Eric's Taxis).
```

### To filter by number of passengers:
```
Introduce the number of passengers and then the filter will be applied to the search results obtained before.
```
